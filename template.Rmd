You'll need to install both `remotes` and `tidytuesdayR` to do this:

```

```{r}

library(tidytuesdayR)
#This will open up in the help window
tidytuesdayR::tt_available()
```

# What was your dataset?

Load your dataset in with the function below. The input is the date the dataset was issued. You should be able to get this from the `tt_available()` function.
